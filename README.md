### Advertising Sales Prediction
This project uses the Advertising dataset to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending. The dataset includes data on advertising spending across multiple media channels (TV, radio, and newspaper) and the corresponding sales revenue for a product. We use scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python, to create a Linear Regression model to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending.

#### Dataset
The Advertising dataset contains 200 observations of advertising spending across TV, radio, and newspaper, as well as the corresponding sales revenue for a product. The dataset is available in the file Advertising.csv, which is included in this repository. The dataset is in comma-separated value (CSV) format.

#### Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies:

1. Pandas
2. Scikit-learn
3. Matplotlib
